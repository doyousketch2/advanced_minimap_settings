# minimap_gui
GUI for Minetest minimap  

Type **.m** or **.map** to access GUI.  


Took it apart, then put it back together.  
Mostly done as an excercise so I can learn Minetest client-side mods.  

**code cleanup:**  
- [x] removed unused register_globalstep() function  
- [x] merged separate register_on_connect() functions  
- [x] refactored large *elseif* code blocks  
- [x] descriptive comments  
- [x] closing comments  
- [x] better spacing  
- [x] GNU - AGPL v3
